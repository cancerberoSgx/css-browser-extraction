#CSS Browser Extraction

TODO - WIP

Imagine you have a Big Single Page HTML Application that loads A LOT of CSS initially for all your project- Loading big CSS file can block the initial page rendering (TODO reference) so what about discovering only the CSS rules that apply to the initial page and load only that initially. Then when the page has render start loading the entire stylesheet.

This project try to tackle this problem. It is a tool that runs in the browser - you just pass it a target element that you want to extract CSS.
